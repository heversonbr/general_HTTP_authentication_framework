# General HTTP authentication framework


This example `basic_user_authentication_webapp` shows how to perform user authentication, just like described in the 'The general HTTP authentication framework'.

More information about this framework [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication#the_general_http_authentication_framework).

It does not apply a specific `authentication method`, it only applies the `challenge/response` approach, by comparing  `username/password` with the ones stored in a database.

**NOTE** 

In this example, the password is exchaged in plaintext, of course it should NOT be like this in a real application.
