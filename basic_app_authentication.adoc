= General HTTP authentication framework


This example (basic_user_authentication_webapp) shows how to perform user authentication, just like described in the 'The general HTTP authentication framework'.
Ref: link::https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication#the_general_http_authentication_framework
Note that, it does not apply a specific authentication method, only applies the 'challenge/response' approach, by comparing the username/password with the ones stored in a database.
In this example, the password is exchaged in plaintext, of course it should not be like this in a real application.
